## Description
You are an archeologist, exploring the Ancient Egyptian ruins.
You must collect as much treasure as you can, but you must avoid the deadly spikes!
Avoid obstacles by timing your jump right(using _w_ or _up arrow_ keys) or ducking (using _s_ or _down arrow_ keys)

### Objective
If you collect as much treasure and powerups you can before the time runs out without losing your 5 lives, YOU WIN! :D

## Technical Details
- This project took a lot of time and effort.
- Every shape on the screen is created from scracth using code and mathematical calculation
- I designed everything myself then implemented it using OpenGL and C++
- Every action is connected to audio feedback using sound effects and visual feedback.
