## Description
You are an archeologist, exploring the Ancient Egyptian ruins.
You must collect as much treasure as you can, but you must avoid the deadly spikes!
Avoid obstacles by timing your jump right(using _w_ or _up arrow_ keys) or ducking (using _s_ or _down arrow_ keys)

### Objective
If you collect as much treasure and powerups you can before the time runs out without losing your 5 lives, YOU WIN! :D
